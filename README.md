# PunchBlocks

PunchBlocks is a brain/body fitness game.

You play a Tetris-like falling blocks game by physically moving your body. Control is through video capture from your webcam using Google MediaPipe, which can recognize human body poses using real-time machine learning. 

The goal is that you get a bit of a light workout while also keeping your brain occupied. 

For this to work, you need a modern browser, a recent desktop/laptop with a webcam, and some space to move around. Mobile devices generally don't have enough processing power to do this video processing in real time.

Before starting, back up far enough from the webcam that it can see your head and extended arms, without seeing any other people. Make sure it's a well-lit space free of obstructions. If it helps, you may want to plug into a monitor or TV so you can see the screen more easily from that distance.

While this game uses your webcam, all processing is local. If you're concerned about privacy, you can even turn off your wifi while playing (after loading the page), and it will still work. 

# Controls
* Punch left to move a block left. 
* Punch right to move a block right.
* Jump or do a jumping jack to rotate a block. 
* Squat to make a block fall. 

# Tips
In order for punching to work, you need to move your hand fast enough to register. Also, your hand has to be in view of the webcam when it is fully extended. You can punch forward or to the side, it does not matter.

Your hand needs to return to a non-punching position between punches. You can't punch twice in a row by holding your arm out. 

The game does not need to see your whole body. It just needs your head and wrists. There is no need to show your legs or feet.

Unlike original Tetris, rotating blocks and making blocks fall is a ton of physical effort. You will get extra points for these motions.

Use a fitness watch to measure your heart rate.

Hold small weights in your hands and the game will become MUCH more difficult. Be careful about injuring your joints though. The best weights for this are under 100 grams.
